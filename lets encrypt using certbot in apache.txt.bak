sudo yum install epel-release

sudo yum install certbot python2-certbot-apache mod_ssl

sudo certbot --apache -d example.com

 The first domain name in the list of parameters will be the base domain used by 
 Let’s Encrypt to create the certificate. For this reason, pass the base domain name as
 first in the list, followed by any additional subdomains or aliases:
	
sudo certbot --apache -d example.com -d www.example.com

sudo certbot --apache

You will also be able to choose between enabling both http and https access or forcing all requests to redirect to https.
For better security,it is recommended to choose the option 2: Redirect if you do not have any special need to allow 
unencrypted connections. Select your choice then hit ENTER.

When the installation is successfully finished, you will see congratulations message

The generated certificate files will be available within a subdirectory named after your base domain in the /etc/letsencrypt/live directory.

Checking your Certificate Status
At this point, you can ensure that Certbot created your SSL certificate correctly by using the SSL Server Test from the cloud security company Qualys.

Open the following link in your preferred web browser, replacing example.com with your base domain:

https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=example.com

nce the test starts running, it may take a few minutes to complete. The status of the test will update in your browser.

When the testing finishes, the page will display a letter grade that rates the security and quality of your server’s configuration.
At the time of this writing, default settings will give an A rating:

Step 4 — Setting Up Auto Renewal
Let’s Encrypt certificates are valid for 90 days, but it’s recommended that you renew the certificates every 60 days to allow a margin of error. 
Because of this, it is a best practice to automate this process to periodically check and renew the certificate.

First, let’s examine the command that you will use to renew the certificate. The certbot Let’s Encrypt client has a renew command that 
automatically checks the currently installed certificates and tries to renew them if they are less than 30 days away
from the expiration date. By using the --dry-run option, you can run a simulation of this task to test how renew works:

sudo certbot renew --dry-run

Notice that if you created a bundled certificate with multiple domains, only the base domain name will be shown in the output,
 but the renewal will be valid for all domains included in this certificate.

A practical way to ensure your certificates will not get outdated is to create a cron job that will periodically execute 
the automatic renewal command for you. Since the renewal first checks for the expiration date and only executes
the renewal if the certificate is less than 30 days away from expiration,
it is safe to create a cron job that runs every week or even every day.

Edit the crontab to create a new job that will run the renewal twice per day. To edit the crontab for the root user, run:

sudo crontab -e

0 0,12 * * * python -c 'import random; import time; time.sleep(random.random() * 3600)' && certbot renew
