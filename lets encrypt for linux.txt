Lets Encrypt on Linux:

1. yum install httpd
2.yum -y install mod_ssl
3.systemctl start httpd.service 
4. yum install epel-release
5. yum install certbot python2-certbot-apache mod_ssl

5. yum install git
6. cd /usr/local/
7. git clone https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt
8.cd /usr/local/letsencrypt
9. ./letsencrypt-auto --apache -d your_domain.tld
10. Supply the email address that will be used by Let’s Encrypt to recover your lost key
    or for urgent notices and press Enter to continue. 
11. Agree the terms of the license by hitting Enter key.
12. select the ssl.conf file to be automatically modified by Let’s Encrypt client and press Enter to continue.
13.choose the Easy method for HTTP requests and press Enter to move forward.

    Press Enter to release the prompt.
   

                       ### Test ###
1.In order to test the straightness of your domain SSL/TLS handshake visit the below link and test your
  certificate on your domain.

https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html
2.  If you receive a series of reports concerning your domain vulnerability in the conducted tests, then you need to fix those security holes urgently.

An overall rating of C class makes your domain very insecure. To fix these security problems, open Apache SSL configuration file and make the following changes:

# vim /etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf

3. Search for line with SSLProtocol statement and add -SSLv3 at the end of the line
4. Go deeper in the file, search and comment the line with SSLCipherSuite by 
    placing a # in front of it and add the following content under this line:
SSLCipherSuite          ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-DSS-AES128-GCM-SHA256:kEDH+AESGCM:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:AES128-GCM-SHA256:AES256-GCM-SHA384:AES128-SHA256:AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES:CAMELLIA:DES-CBC3-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!RC4:!MD5:!PSK:!aECDH:!EDH-DSS-DES-CBC3-SHA:!EDH-RSA-DES-CBC3-SHA:!KRB5-DES-CBC3-SHA
SSLHonorCipherOrder     on
SSLOptions +StrictRequire
5. After you’ve made all the above changes, save and close the file, then restart Apache daemon to apply changes.

# systemctl restart httpd.service  

6. Now, tests the status of your domain encryption again, by visiting the same link as above. To perform retests hit the Clear cache link from the website.

       ######  Auto Renew Let’s Encrypt Certificates on Apache ######
This beta version of Let’s Encrypt software releases certificates with expiration date after 90 days. So, in order to renew the SSL certificate, you must execute the letsencrypt-auto command again before expiration date, with the same options and flags used to obtain the initial certificate.

An example on how to manually renew the certificate is presented below.

1. cd /usr/local/letsencrypt
2. ./letsencrypt-auto certonly --apache --renew-by-default  -d your_domain.tld
