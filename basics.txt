4.URL and URI
there are two types of URI:

URL: URL specifies a location on the computer network and technique for retrieving it.
URN: Uniform Resource Name (URN) is an internet resource that specifies URN scheme.

Here is a Syntax of URL:

http://www.domainname.com/folder-name/web page-file-name.htm

Here is a syntax of URI:

URI = scheme:[//authority]path[?query][#fragment]


URL	                                                                    URI

URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator.	                  URI stands for Uniform Resource Identifier.

URL is a subset of URI that specifies where a 
resource is exists and the mechanism for retrieving it.	        A URI is a superset of URL that identifies a resource either by URL or URN (Uniform Resource Name) or both.

The main aim is to get the location or address of a resource	The main aim of URI is to find a resource and differentiate it from other resources using either name or location.

URL is used to locate only web pages Used in HTML, XML and other
files XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations) and more.

The scheme must be a protocol like HTTP, FTP, HTTPS, etc.	  In URI, thls       Example of URI:urn:isbn:0-486-27557-4

It contains components such as protocol,                             It contains components like scheme, authority, path, query, fragment component, etc.
domain, path, hash, query string, etc.


Linux Network Basics:

1.lspci | grep ethernet = to know the pci card name
2. Network Manager is a daemon or service responsible for network
 It has two entities:
    1. Device      2. Connection
   (1)Device is actual hardware like ens33(ethernet interface slot 33)
   (2)connection is a network setting given to inerface like ens33 . there may be 
      multiple connection for a single interface.
     e.g. nmcli connection add con-name="kimaya" type ethernet ifname ens33 ipv4 192.168.98.131/24 gw4 192.168.98.1
3. cat /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/igcfg-kimaya
here you can check setting of connection
here BOOTPROTO=none means static or manual ip address otherwise through DHCP




Troubleshooting:
1. trobleshooting for linux ,like windows not loaded correctly.
    for windows:follow this-- > see advanced repaire options-->troubleshoot-->advanced options-->
                              startup settings-->restart-->then f4 enable safe mode and then again restart

2. when your linux machine is stuck at starting, this happens because of drivers then follow the below steps:
            1.switch on your machine
            2.when you are at grub boot loader (at the blue screen where it asks to choose the os)-- 
              keep the cursor on the os you want and press 'E'button from your keyboard
            3.new window pops  up go to the linux line and at the very  end type
              nouveau.modeset=0
            4.press 'F10 ' key 
            5.after the os starts go to software and updates --go to settings --go to additional drivers
              --change it to nvidea driver (proprietary based)
 

                           ######## PORT ########
* A port in computer networking is how a computer can use a single physical network connection to handle many incoming 
and outgoing requests by assigning a port number to each. The numbers go from 0 to 65535, which is a 16-bit number.

*  The company telephone number is like the computer Internet Protocol (IP) address orUniform Resource Locator (URL).
 It connects users with the correct company but does not define who they want to talk to in the company. 
A telephone extension will connect them with the right person in an organization, however, 
and the port will connect them to the right service on a computer.              

* As an example of ports in use, say a company wants to have a website, email and secure file transfer service on the internet. 
  Its firewall would allow inbound connections to ports 80 and 443 for web traffic, port 25 for inbound email and port 22 for Secure Shell FTP (SFTP). 
  It forwards these ports to the specific servers for each type of service. The firewall will block all other ports.

        ####permissions:#####
Read: Having read permission on a file grants the right to read the contents of the file.
         Read permission on a directory implies the ability to list all the files in the directory.
Write: Write permission implies the ability to change the contents of the file (for a file)
         or create new files in the directory (for a directory 
Execute: Execute permission on files means the right to execute them, if they are programs.
         (Files that are not programs should not be given the execute permission.) 
         For directories, execute permission allows you to enter the directory (i.e., cd into it),
         and to access any of its files.


      ####  Linux Vs Windows  #####
1. linux is a opensource os.
2. It is more secure than windows.security based on permission , so any .exe files are not get executed directly.
   Root permissions are strict. other user has limited permissions.
3. In linux directories are separated by forward slash(/) , in windows by backward slash(\).


     ##### Locate and Find command #####
* Find :-
  searches in the real system. Is slower but always up-to-date and has more options (size, modification time,...)
   It will work in an online/"in real time" mode
   Find is able to recursively search any given path for various files. 
   Using the file command we can search for files by name, owner, group, permissions, 
   type, size, time modified, date and various other criteria.
e.g. 1. find / -name findme
     2. find / -name "*.txt"
     3. find / -type f -name findme


* Locate :-
 It uses a previously built database (command updatedb).
 Is much faster, but uses an 'older' database and searches only names or parts of them.
 It will work in an offline mode:
 locate is a Unix utility which serves to find files on filesystems. It searches through a prebuilt local database of
 all files on the filesystem generated by the updatedb command. Note it is essential to update the database as 
 recent files saved over a period of fewer than 24 hours are not updated into the database by default
 and the database is updated once within 24 hours span. 
 e.g locate findme
      updatedb


    ##### SHELL-SCRIPTING #####
1. sh -x script_name --> is used to debug the script
2. hint: you can take each command one by one and execute it to check where is the bug.
